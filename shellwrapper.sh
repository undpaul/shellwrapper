# Shell wrapper to execute subshells and exportshells of a specified directory.
#
# Subshells are scripts with the extension ".sh" and will be called via the
# command "sh -e".
# Sub shells do not share variables with each other. To do that you have to
# implement a source shell.
#
# Export shells are scripts with the extension ".exportsh" and will be called
# with the source command. So they are handled as the would be called from the
# original script and so can register variables for the whole script by using
# the "export" command.
# So source shells can be used to set up some basic variables for the subshells.
#
# Arguments:
# 1: directory to load the source - the path must be absolute or relative to
#    this file's location
# 2: tag - a string that will be used to determine some scripts that only should
#    be called when that tag is given.
#    Files that end on .TAG.sh or .TAG.exportsh will be called in that case.
#    Otherwise those would not be called.
#    Multiple tags can be separated by comma "," (e.g. stage,search)
